<title> Fatal Police Shootings from 2015 to 2020 </title>

<h1><b>Fatal Police Shootings from 2015 to 2020</b></h1>
<p> <b> made by Ronald Lagos </b> </p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p> There has been political/social turnmoil this year, aside from a virus
    and outrageous presidential elections a controversial topic has been Black Lives Matter.
    While the name itself isn't something that should be debated people have made this a political issue too.
    In Fox news people such as <i>Tucker Carlson</i> say that "If we're going to survive as a country, we must defeat Black Lives Matter" treating
    the movement as a fascist group. Meanwhile, people on CNN such as anchor <i>Don Lemon</i> believe that 
    "Black Lives Matters is about police brutality not black on black crime; black people face discrimination everyday." According to an article in 
    <i>prnewswire</i> there is a about 63% of Democrats believe "Black Lives Matter" and 
    87% of Republicans believe that "All Lives Matter."  </p>

<h3>So what does this leave us with?</h3>
<p> This has left people confused, angry, anxious, afraid, and annoyed. Everyone has different opinions on every topic and <b>that's okay</b>
but in times like these we can trust one thing and that is data. Lucky for us the Washington Post has gathered data of fatal police shootings 
from 2015 to 2020. Some may argue that Washington Post is very liberal. However, data is data. We are going to check out which race has gone through the most 
fatal shootings in the past 5 years. </p>

<p> <i>We are not going to make any conclusions we are just interpreting the data that is given</i></p>
