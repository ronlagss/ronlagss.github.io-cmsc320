<title> Fatal Police Shootings from 2015 to 2020 </title>

<h1><b>Fatal Police Shootings from 2015 to 2020</b></h1>
<p> <b> made by Ronald Lagos </b> </p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p> There has been political/social turnmoil this year, aside from a virus
    and outrageous presidential elections a controversial topic has been Black Lives Matter.
    While the name itself isn't something that should be debated people have made this a political issue too.
    In Fox news people such as <i>Tucker Carlson</i> say that "If we're going to survive as a country, we must defeat Black Lives Matter" treating
    the movement as a fascist group. Meanwhile, people on CNN such as anchor <i>Don Lemon</i> believe that 
    "Black Lives Matters is about police brutality not black on black crime; black people face discrimination everyday." According to an article in 
    <i>prnewswire</i> there is a about 63% of Democrats believe "Black Lives Matter" and 
    87% of Republicans believe that "All Lives Matter."  </p>

<h3>So what does this leave us with?</h3>
<p> This has left people confused, angry, anxious, afraid, and annoyed. Everyone has different opinions on every topic and <b>that's okay</b>
but in times like these we can trust one thing and that is data. Lucky for us the Washington Post has gathered data of fatal police shootings 
from 2015 to 2020. Some may argue that Washington Post is very liberal. However, data is data. We are going to check out which race has gone through the most 
fatal shootings in the past 5 years. This data has the race of deceased, circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed, whether the victim was experiencing a mental health crisis, and others.
 </p>

<p> <i>We are not going to make any conclusions we are just interpreting the data that is given</i></p>

<p><b>Required Tools </b></p>
<ul>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>requests</li>
    <li>html5lib</li>
    <li>os.path</li>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>matplotlib.pyplot</li> 
    <p> We highly recommend using this resource to learn how to import libraries in to your python code https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3 </p>   
</ul>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>Here we will be getting the data from kaggle a public source for data. The dataset starts on January 1st, 2015. 
    Once every required tool is imported into the program. Below is a picture as to what each of the libraries is going to do to our code and how it is going to help us 
</p>
(show how it will be used) We are going to get a data frame here and as you can see there are a lot of unnecessary columns
(talk about how csv file will be concactenated)
<p>

</p>
<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p> Since we have many columns that we won't be using we will <i>tidy up</i> the data to it is easier 
to analyze. Since we will be altering the structure of a Dataframe this is considered <i> Data Wrangling</i>. Below is the code that shows us how to tidy it up. 
</p>
<p>Here we simply need the race of the person, age and year the incident happened. Below is the result of that once we tipy up the data into what is useful to us.
    To make it more a lot more efficient and easily recognizable we will convert the race letter into the word <i>H = Hispanic
    W = White B = Black </i>
</p>

<h3>Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>
This is the Exploratory Analysis and Visualization stage of the data life cycle where 
we attempt to plot our data in order to observe potential trends or correlations. Keeping in mind that correlation does not mean causation. 
</p>
<p>
    This is a bar graph that will tell us which race was in the most fatal shots by police, and also we will check out the age of the person
</p>
<p>
    Below is a heatmap to see where most of these shootings happened
</p>
<h3><b>Observations</b></h3>
<p>
    During this phase of the Data Lifecycle, we attempt to perform various modeling techniques such as linear regression and logistic regression.
We will perforn a linear regression race vs age, location vs race.
